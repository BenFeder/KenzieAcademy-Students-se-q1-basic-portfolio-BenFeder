    <p>
      I was born in Philadelphia. I lived there for four years before moving out
      to the suburbs. I grew up in a family of five, and currently have two dogs
      and two cats.

      After graduating from Boston, I moved to NYC. I had several jobs there
      from sales jobs to restaurant jobs before working as an IT consultant.
      Programming was always an interesting and fun thing for me in my mind, and
      something I knew I could excel in. Happy to now be with Kenzie Academy!
